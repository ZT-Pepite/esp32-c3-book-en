# Book Structure

This book takes an engineer-centered perspective and expounds the necessary knowledge for IoT project development step by step. It is composed of four parts, as follows:

- [**Preparation**](../chapter_1/README.md) (Chapter 1-4): This part introduces the architecture of IoT, typical IoT project framework, the ESP RainMaker&reg; cloud platform, and the development environment ESP-IDF, so as to lay a solid foundation for IoT project development.

- [**Hardware and Driver Development**](../chapter_5/README.md) (Chapter 5-6): Based on the ESP32-C3 chipset, this part elaborates on the minimum hardware system and driver development, and implements the control of dimming, colour grading, and wireless communication.

- [**Wireless Communication and Control**](../chapter_7/README.md) (Chapter 7-11): This part explains the intelligent Wi-Fi configuration scheme based on ESP32-C3 chip, local & cloud control protocols, and local & remote control of devices. It also provides schemes for developing smartphone apps, firmware upgrade, and version management.

- [**Optimisation and Mass Production**](../chapter_12/README.md) (Chapter 12-15): This part is intended for advanced IoT applications, focusing on optimisation of products in power management, low-power optimisation, and enhanced security. It also introduces firmware burning and testing in mass production, and how to diagnose the running status and logs of device firmware through the remote monitoring platform ESP Insights.
