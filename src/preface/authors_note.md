# Author’s Note

This book is officially produced by Espressif Systems and is written by the company’s senior engineers. It is suitable for managers and R&D personnel in IoT-related industries, teachers and students of related majors, and enthusiasts in the field of Internet of Things. We hope that this book can serve as a work manual, a reference, and a bedside book, to be like a good tutor and friend.

While compiling this book, we referred to some relevant research results of experts, scholars, and technicians at home and abroad, and we did our best to cite them according to academic norms. However, it is unavoidable that there should be some omissions, so here we would like to express our deep respect and gratitude to all the relevant authors. In addition, we have quoted information from the Internet, so we would like to thank the original authors and publishers and apologise that we cannot indicate the source of every piece of information.

In order to produce a book of high quality, we have organised rounds of internal discussions, and learned from the suggestions and feedback of trial readers and publisher editors. Here, we would like to thank you again for your help which all contributed to this successful work.

Last, but the most importantly, thanks to everyone at Espressif who has worked so hard for the birth and popularization of our products.

The development of IoT projects involves a wide range of knowledge. Limited to the length of the book, as well as the level and experience of the author, omissions are unavoidable. Therefore, we kindly request that experts and readers criticise and correct our mistakes. If you have any suggestions for this book, please contact us at <book@espressif.com>. We look forward to your feedback.
