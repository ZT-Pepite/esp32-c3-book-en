# Flashing the Blink Program
For Linux systems, connect the ESP32-C3 to the computer via USB-UART
chip (such as CP2102), and use the command `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` to view the
serial port number. If the current serial port number printed is
`/dev/ttyUSB0`, use the command `idf.py -p /dev`\
`/ttyUSB0 flash` to flash the program onto the ESP32-C3.

For Mac systems, connect the ESP32-C3 to the computer via USB-UART chip
(such as CP2102), and use the command `ls /dev/cu.*` to view the serial
port number. If the current serial port number printed is
`/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART`, use the command `idf.py `\
`-p /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART flash` to flash the program onto the
ESP32-C3.

For Windows systems, connect the ESP32-C3 to the computer via USB-UART
chip (such as CP2102), and view the serial port number through the
device manager. If the current serial port number is `COM5`, use the
command `idf.py -p COM5 flash` to flash the program onto the ESP32-C3.

After the flashing process is completed, you will see a prompt as shown
in Figure 4.22 in the console. When the following log appears, the code
will start executing, and the LED on the development board will start
flashing.
