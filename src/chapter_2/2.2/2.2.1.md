# Project Structure

The Smart Light project consists of three parts:

<ol type="i">
 <li><b>Smart light devices based on ESP32-C3</b>, responsible for interacting with IoT cloud platforms, and controlling the switch, brightness and color temperature of the LED lamp beads.</li>
<br>
 <li><b>Smartphone apps</b> (including tablet apps running on Android and iOS), responsible for network configuration of smart light products, as well as querying and controlling their status.</li>
<br>
 <li><b>An IoT cloud platform based on ESP RainMaker</b>. For simplification, we consider the IoT cloud platform and business server as a whole in this book. Details about ESP RainMaker will be provided in Chapter 3.</li>
</ol>

The correspondence between the Smart Light project structure and the architecture of IoT is shown in Figure 2.1.
